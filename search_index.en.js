One of the first\nissues I ran into was performance: saving files became deadly slow, to the\npoint where I gave up and disabled format-on-save.\nThe thing is: prettier is known to be a fast code formatter, and I didn't have\nthe issue before, so what's the  problem here? Is Neovim making prettier\nslower? Is coc-prettier doing some magic shit?\nBefore we start looking into this, let's see how prettier behaves when\nformatting a somewhat large TypeScript file:\n％ wc -l sample.ts\n     586 sample.ts\n％ time npx prettier -w sample.ts\nsample.ts 332ms\n        0.85 real         0.91 user         0.11 sys\n\nIt's interesting that prettier reports that it took 332ms to format the file,\nbut time reports that the whole process took 850ms. Who's lying?\nLet's take a look at multiple files:\n％ wc -l sample*.ts\n     330 sample1.ts\n     718 sample2.ts\n     655 sample3.ts\n    2511 sample4.ts\n     601 sample5.ts\n    4815 total\n％ time npx prettier -w sample1.ts\nsample1.ts 290ms\n        0.93 real         0.88 user         0.11 sys\n％ time npx prettier -w sample2.ts\nsample2.ts 358ms\n        1.02 real         1.04 user         0.12 sys\n％ time npx prettier -w sample3.ts\nsample3.ts 330ms\n        0.97 real         0.95 user         0.13 sys\n％ time npx prettier -w sample4.ts\nsample4.ts 648ms\n        1.27 real         1.48 user         0.13 sys\n％ time npx prettier -w sample5.ts\nsample5.ts 375ms\n        1.00 real         1.00 user         0.12 sys\n\nNotice how formatting sample2.ts and sample4.ts takes more than 1 second in\ntotal! Also interesting is the fact that even though sample1.ts is less the\nhalf the size of sample2.ts, formatting sample2.ts does not take twice as\nmuch time.\nWho cares?!\nOK, let's take a step back and reflect: who cares if prettier is slow to format\nmy files? I could run it on a git hook or something like that and not even\nnotice.\nAs I mentioned before, I was running format-on-save in Neovim, with a simple\nsetup, not very fancy:\nautocmd BufWritePre *.ts execute \"silent %!npx prettier --stdin-filepath '\" . expand('%:p') . \"'\"\n\n(it was a bit fancier than that, but not by much)\nSo, imagine you're using Neovim and every time you save the file you have to\nwait 1 second. You'd be mad, right?! There must be a better way...\n\"My Visual Studio Code doesn't take a second to format-on-save, your Vim is trash\"\nTo be fair, coc-prettier was pretty fast too. How is that even possible?\nLet's go back to our sample files, but this time let's see what prettier does\nif we pass all 5 files to it instead of invoking it 5 times:\n％ time npx prettier -w *.ts\nsample1.ts 248ms\nsample2.ts 205ms\nsample3.ts 110ms\nsample4.ts 327ms\nsample5.ts 79ms\n        1.61 real         2.09 user         0.15 sys\n\nThis time sample2.ts is faster than sample1.ts, even though it's twice as\nlarge! What's going on? Turns out prettier is slow to\nstart, both because of\noverhead introduced by node.js and prettier itself (it has tons of plugins and\ndependencies).\nAnd how is it fast to format-on-save using VSCode/coc-prettier? Simple:\nboth coc-prettier and Visual Studio Code are long-running node.js processes,\nwhich host prettier as a library, therefore paying the initialization cost\nonce.\nThe solution is simple: we need a long-running node.js process! If you read\nthrough the issue about slow startups in prettier, someone suggests using\nprettier_d, but after looking at\nhow large that project was, I was a bit scared.\nDoing some more research, I found\neslint_d.js, which solves a similar\nissue for eslint, by introducing a daemon which supports binding on a TCP\nsocket! And the author of eslint_d.js extracted its core functionality in a\nlibrary called core_d.js. So I figured\nI could combine that library with prettier and make\nprettierd, a TCP-enabled daemon for\nformatting code using prettier!\nInstalling and starting prettierd\nThe code for prettierd is pretty boring, as it is basically a tiny wrapper\naround core_d to invoke the proper prettier functions whenever the server\nreceives a \"request\". The two important things to know about are:\n\nYou can install it with npm and start it with prettierd start:\n\n％ npm install -g @fsouza/prettierd\n％ prettierd start\n\nAlternatively you can do both things with npx:\n％ npx -p @fsouza/prettierd prettierd start\n\n\nWhen it starts, prettierd writes a file with its port number and token\n\n％ cat ~/.prettierd\n53561 cb2ad753df0aca85\n\nThis means that prettierd is running on port 53561 and we can use the token\ncb2ad753df0aca85 in our requests to format our source code.\ncore_d's protocol is pretty simple:\n&lt;token&gt; &lt;working-dir&gt; &lt;file-name&gt;\\n\n&lt;file-content&gt;\n\nFor example, we can use netcat:\n％ echo \"cb2ad753df0aca85 $PWD sample2.ts\" | cat - sample2.ts | /usr/bin/time nc localhost 53561 &gt;sample2-formatted.ts\n        0.14 real         0.00 user         0.00 sys\n\nRemember how formatting sample2.ts took over 1 second? Not anymore. :)\nIntegrating Neovim with prettierd\nUsing netcat is great and we could probably write a shell script that we could\nuse in our (fun fact: someone else did this, check the bonus section!), but\nNeovim is powerful enough to connect directly to the TCP server.\nHow? Neovim has an event loop, which is implemented using\nlibuv. libuv is probably the best event loop there in the\nwild, but don't quote me :) Besides shipping the event loop and all the libuv\ncode, Neovim also bundles luv and expose the\nloop as a Lua API, so we can use vim.loop.&lt;nice-async-things&gt;! Taylor\nThompson has written an amazing post about the using libuv in\nNeovim, go check it out if you're curious :)\nAmong the utilities provided by libuv, there's a tcp module which includes both\na TCP client and a TCP server! In our case we want to use a client, so we\ninvoke the tcp_connect function:\nlocal callback = ...\nlocal port = 53561\nlocal token = 'cb2ad753df0aca85'\nlocal client = vim.loop.new_tcp()\nvim.loop.tcp_connect(client, '127.0.0.1', port, callback)\n\nSince this is async world, we need to pass a callback that gets executed\nwhenever the connection happens (or in case something goes wrong). So the first\nthing we do in our callback is check for errors, which looks familiar for Go\ndevelopers:\nlocal callback = function(err)\n  if err then\n    error(err)\n  end\n\n  ...\nend\n\nIf there are no errors, it means we can send the contents of our file to the\nremote server. We have the port and the token, but we also need the contents of\nthe buffer. So let's grab the contents of the current buffer and send that to\nthe server, then read back the response and write it back to the buffer! This\ntime I'll include the entire implementation of the callback, with some inline\ncomments:\nlocal callback = function(err)\n  if err then\n    error(err)\n  end\n\n  -- grab the contents of the buffer and add first row to match core_d's protocol\n  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()\n  local first_line = string.format('%s %s %s', token, vim.loop.cwd(), 'sample2.js')\n  local lines = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(bufnr, 0, -1, true)\n  table.insert(lines, 1, first_line)\n\n  -- start reading the response\n  local response = ''\n  vim.loop.read_start(client, function(read_err, chunk)\n    -- check if there was any error reading data back, if so, close the\n    -- connection and report the error.\n    if read_err then\n      vim.loop.close(client)\n      error('failed to read data from prettierd: ' .. read_err)\n    end\n\n    -- libuv will call this callback with no data and no error when it's done,\n    -- so if there's data, concatenate it into the final response. Otherwise it\n    -- means we're done, so invoke the `write_to_buf` to write the data back.\n    if chunk then\n      response = response .. chunk\n    else\n      vim.loop.close(client)\n      write_to_buf(response, bufnr)\n    end\n  end)\n\n  -- write the request\n  vim.loop.write(client, table.concat(lines, '\\n'))\n\n  -- signal to the server that we're done writing the request\n  vim.loop.shutdown(client)\nend\n\nAnd here's a simple implementation of write_to_buf. The trickiest bit is\nerror handling: the way errors are reported isn't great, but it's acceptable:\nif prettier fails, the last line contains a message in the format # exit &lt;code&gt; ....\nlocal function write_to_buf(data, bufnr)\n  local new_lines = vim.split(data, '\\n')\n\n  -- check for errors\n  if string.find(new_lines[#new_lines], '^# exit %d+') then\n    error(string.format('failed to format with prettier: %s', data))\n  end\n\n  -- write contents\n  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, 0, -1, false, new_lines)\nend\n\nNow you can throw all of that in a format() function and invoke it on write!\n\nNote: the code here is a simplified version of what I actually use. For\nthe actual config, including automatic process management, retries, error\nhandling and cursor positioning, checkout\nprettierd.lua\nin my dotfiles repo.\n\nNot just TypeScript and JavaScript\nUsers of prettier are aware of this, but prettier is not just about JavaScript\nand TypeScript, it can be used with many other file formats, including HTML,\nMarkdown, CSS, YAML, JSON and others. Check the parser configuration in\nprettier docs for a full\nlist, and keep in mind that additional file types can be added via plugins!\nBonus: using it on the command line with prettierme\nIf you want to use Vim instead of Neovim, or don't want to maintain a TCP\nclient in your editor configuration, you can leverage Ruy Adorno's\nprettierme to use a command line\ninterface that is more similar to the standard prettier interface. prettierme\nis basically a wrapper around our netcat example.\n","id":"https://blog.fsouza.dev/prettierd-neovim-format-on-save/","title":"Making format-on-save fast with prettierd"},"https://blog.fsouza.dev/setting-up-django-production/":{"body":"Here is another series of posts: now I’m going to write about setting up a\nDjango production environment using\nnginx and Green Unicorn in a\nvirtual environment. The subject in this first post is\nnginx, which is my favorite web server.\nThis post explains how to install nginx from sources, compiling it (on Linux).\nYou might want to use apt, zif, yum or ports, but I prefer building\nfrom sources. So, to build from sources, make sure you have all development\ndependencies (C headers, including the PCRE library headers, nginx rewrite\nmodule uses it). If you want to build nginx with SSL support, keep in mind that\nyou will need the libssl headers too.\nBuild nginx from source is a straightforward process: all you need to do is\ndownload it from the official site and build with some simple options. In our\nsetup, we’re going to install nginx under /opt/nginx, and use it with the\nnginx system user. So, let’s download and extract the latest stable version\n(1.0.9) from nginx website:\n% curl -O http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.0.9.tar.gz\n% tar -xzf nginx-1.0.9.tar.gz\n\nOnce you have extracted it, just configure, compile and install:\n% ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx --user=nginx --group=nginx\n% make\n% [sudo] make install\n\nAs you can see, we provided the /opt/nginx to configure, make sure the /opt\ndirectory exists. Also, make sure that there is a user and a group called\nnginx, if they don’t exist, add them:\n% [sudo] adduser --system --no-create-home --disabled-login --disabled-password --group nginx\n\nAfter that, you can start nginx using the command line below:\n% [sudo] /opt/nginx/sbin/nginx\n\n\nLinode provides an init\nscript that uses\nstart-stop-daemon, you might want\nto use it.\n\nnginx configuration\nnginx comes with a default nginx.conf file, let’s change it to reflect the\nfollowing configuration requirements:\n\nnginx should start workers with the nginx user\nnginx should have two worker processes\nthe PID should be stored in the /opt/nginx/log/nginx.pid file\nnginx must have an access log in /opt/nginx/logs/access.log\nthe configuration for the Django project we’re going to develop should be\nversioned with the entire code, so it must be included in the nginx.conf\nfile (assume that the library project is in the directory /opt/projects).\n\nSo here is the nginx.conf for the requirements above:\nuser  nginx;\nworker_processes  2;\n\npid logs/nginx.pid;\n\nevents {\n    worker_connections  1024;\n}\n\nhttp {\n    include       mime.types;\n    default_type  application/octet-stream;\n\n    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] \"$request\" '\n                     '$status $body_bytes_sent \"$http_referer\" '\n                     '\"$http_user_agent\" \"$http_x_forwarded_for\"';\n\n    access_log  logs/access.log  main;\n\n    sendfile           on;\n    keepalive_timeout  65;\n\n    include /opt/projects/showcase/nginx.conf;\n}\n\nNow we just need to write the configuration for our Django project. I’m using\nan old sample project written while I was working at\nGiran: the name is lojas giranianas, a nonsense\nportuguese joke with a famous brazilian store. It’s an unfinished showcase of\nproducts, it’s like an e-commerce project, but it can’t sell, so it’s just a\nproduct catalog. The code is available at\nGithub. The nginx.conf file\nfor the repository is here:\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name localhost;\n\n    charset utf-8;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP   $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header    Host        $http_host;\n        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;\n    }\n\n    location /static {\n        root /opt/projects/showcase/;\n        expires 1d;\n    }\n}\n\nThe server listens on port 80, responds for the localhost hostname (read\nmore about the Host\nheader). The\nlocation /static directive says that nginx will serve the static files of the\nproject. It also includes an expires directive for caching control. The\nlocation / directive makes a proxy_pass, forwarding all requisitions to an\nupstream server listening on port 8000, this server is the subject of the next\npost of the series: the Green Unicorn (gunicorn) server.\nNot only the HTTP request itself is forwarded to the gunicorn server, but also\nsome headers, that helps to properly deal with the request:\n\nX-Real-IP: forwards the remote address to the upstream server, so it can\nknow the real IP of the user. When nginx forwards the request to gunicorn,\nwithout this header, all gunicorn will know is that there is a request coming\nfrom localhost (or wherever the nginx server is), the remote address is\nalways the IP address of the machine where nginx is running (who actually\nmake the request to gunicorn)\nHost: the Host header is forwarded so gunicorn can treat different\nrequests for different hosts. Without this header, it will be impossible to\nGunicorn to have these constraints\nX-Forwarded-For: also known as XFF, this header provide more precise\ninformation about the real IP who makes the request. Imagine there are 10\nproxies between the user machine and your webserver, the XFF header will all\nthese proxies comma separated. In order to not turn a proxy into an\nanonymizer, it’s a good practice to always forward this header.\n\nSo that is it, in the next post we are going to install and run gunicorn. In\nother posts, we’ll see how to make automated deploys using\nFabric, and some tricks on caching (using the\nproxy_cache directive and integrating Django, nginx and\nmemcached).\nSee you in next posts.\n","id":"https://blog.fsouza.dev/setting-up-django-production/","title":"Setting up a Django production environment: compiling and configuring nginx"},"https://blog.fsouza.dev/splinter-python-tool-for-acceptance/":{"body":"Capybara and\nWebrat are great Ruby tools for acceptance\ntests. A few months ago, we started a great tool for acceptance tests in\nPython web applications, called\nSplinter. There are many acceptance test\ntools on Python world: Selenium,\nAlfajor,\nWindmill,\nMechanize,\nzope.testbrowser, etc.\nSplinter was not created to be another acceptance tool, but an abstract layer\nover other tools, its goal is provide a unique API that make acceptance testing\neasier and funnier.\nIn this post, I will show some basic usage of Splinter for simple web\napplication tests. Splinter is a tool\nuseful on tests of any web application. You can even test a Java web\napplication using Splinter. This post example is a \"test\" of a Facebook\nfeature, just because I want to focus on how to use Splinter, not on how to\nwrite a web application. The feature to be tested is the creation of an event\n(the Splinter sprint), following all the flow: first the user will login on\nFacebook, then click on \"Events\" menu item, then click on \"Create an Event\"\nbutton, enter all event information and click on \"Create event\" button. So,\nlet’s do it…\nFirst step is create a\nBrowser\ninstance, which will provide method for interactions with browser (where the\nbrowser is: Firefox, Chrome, etc.). The code we need for it is very simple:\nbrowser = Browser(\"firefox\")\n\nBrowser is a class and its constructor receives the driver to be used with\nthat instance. Nowadays, there are three drivers for Splinter: firefox,\nchrome and zope.testbrowser. We are using Firefox, and you can easily use\nChrome by simply changing the driver from firefox to chrome. It’s also very\nsimple to add another driver to Splinter, and I plan to cover how to do that in\nanother blog post here.\nA new browser session is started when we got the browser object, and this is\nthe object used for Firefox interactions. Let's start a new event on Facebook,\nthe Splinter Sprint. First of all, we need to visit the Facebook homepage.\nThere is a visit method on Browser class, so we can use it:\nbrowser.visit(\"https://www.facebook.com\")\n\nvisit is a blocking operation: it waits for page to load, then we can\nnavigate, click on links, fill forms, etc. Now we have Facebook homepage opened\non browser, and you probably know that we need to login on Facebook page, but\nwhat if we are already logged in? So, let's create a method that login on\nFacebook with provided authentication data only the user is not logged in\n(imagine we are on a TestCase class):\ndef do_login_if_need(self, username, password):\n    if self.browser.is_element_present_by_css('div.menu_login_container'):\n        self.browser.fill('email', username)\n        self.browser.fill('pass', password)\n        self.browser.find_by_css('div.menu_login_container input[type=\"submit\"]').first.click()\n        assert self.browser.is_element_present_by_css('li#navAccount')\n\nWhat was made here? First of all, the method checks if there is an element\npresent on the page, using a CSS selector. It checks for a div that contains\nthe username and password fields. If that div is present, we tell the\nbrowser object to fill those fields, then find the submit button and click on\nit. The last line is an assert to guarantee that the login was successful and\nthe current page is the Facebook homepage (by checking the presence of\n“Account” li).\nWe could also find elements\nby its texts, labels or whatever appears on screen, but remember: Facebook is\nan internationalized web application, and we can’t test it using only a\nspecific language.\nOkay, now we know how to visit a webpage, check if an element is present, fill\na form and click on a button. We're also logged in on Facebook and can finally\ngo ahead create the Splinter sprint event. So, here is the event creation\nflow, for a user:\n\nOn Facebook homepage, click on “Events” link, of left menu\nThe “Events” page will load, so click on “Create an Event” button\nThe user see a page with a form to create an event\nFill the date and chose the time\nDefine what is the name of the event, where it will happen and write a short\ndescription for it\nInvite some guests\nUpload a picture for the event\nClick on “Create Event” button\n\nWe are going to do all these steps, except the 6th, because the Splinter Sprint\nwill just be a public event and we don’t need to invite anybody. There are some\nboring AJAX requests on Facebook that we need to deal, so there is not only\nSplinter code for those steps above. First step is click on “Events” link. All\nwe need to do is find the link and click on it:\nbrowser.find_by_css('li#navItem_events a').first.click()\n\nThe find_by_css method takes a CSS selector and returns an\nElementList.\nSo, we get the first element of the list (even when the selector returns only\nan element, the return type is still a list) and click on it. Like visit\nmethod, click is a blocking operation: the driver will only listen for new\nactions when the request is finished (the page is loaded).\nWe’re finally on \"new event\" page, and there is a form on screen waiting for data of the Splinter Sprint. Let’s fill the form. Here is the code for it:\nbrowser.fill('event_startIntlDisplay', '5/21/2011')\nbrowser.select('start_time_min', '480')\nbrowser.fill('name', 'Splinter sprint')\nbrowser.fill('location', 'Rio de Janeiro, Brazil')\nbrowser.fill('desc', 'For more info, check out the #cobratem channel on freenode!')\n\nThat is it: the event is going to happen on May 21th 2011, at 8:00 in the\nmorning (480 minutes). As we know, the event name is Splinter sprint, and we\nare going to join some guys down here in Brazil. We filled out the form using\nfill and select methods.\nThe fill method is used to fill a \"fillable\" field (a textarea, an input,\netc.). It receives two strings: the first is the name of the field to fill\nand the second is the value that will fill the field. select is used to\nselect an option in a select element (a “combo box”). It also receives two\nstring parameters: the first is the name of the select element, and the\nsecond is the value of the option being selected.\nImagine you have the following select element:\n&lt;select name=\"gender\"&gt;\n    &lt;option value=\"m\"&gt;Male&lt;/option&gt;\n    &lt;option value=\"f\"&gt;Female&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n\nTo select “Male”, you would call the select method this way:\nbrowser.select(\"gender\", \"m\")\n\nThe last action before click on “Create Event” button is upload a picture for\nthe event. On new event page, Facebook loads the file field for picture\nuploading inside an iframe, so we need to switch to this frame and interact\nwith the form present inside the frame. To show the frame, we need to click on\n“Add Event Photo” button and then switch to it, we already know how click on a\nlink:\nbrowser.find_by_css('div.eventEditUpload a.uiButton').first.click()\n\nWhen we click this link, Facebook makes an asynchronous request, which means\nthe driver does not stay blocked waiting the end of the request, so if we try\nto interact with the frame BEFORE it appears, we will get an\nElementDoesNotExist exception. Splinter provides the is_element_present\nmethod that receives an argument called wait_time, which is the time Splinter\nwill wait for the element to appear on the screen. If the element does not\nappear on screen, we can’t go on, so we can assume the test failed (remember we\nare testing a Facebook feature):\nif not browser.is_element_present_by_css('iframe#upload_pic_frame', wait_time=10):\n    fail(\"The upload pic iframe did'n't appear :(\")\n\nThe is_element_present_by_css method takes a CSS selector and tries to find\nan element using it. It also receives a wait_time parameter that indicates a\ntime out for the search of the element. So, if the iframe element with\nID=”upload_pic_frame” is not present or doesn’t appear in the screen after 10\nseconds, the method returns False, otherwise it returns True.\n\nImportant: fail is a pseudocode sample and doesn’t exist (if you’re\nusing unittest library, you can invoke self.fail in a TestCase, exactly\nwhat I did in [complete snippet for this\nexample](https://github.com/cobrateam/splinter/blob/master/samples/test_facebook_events.py\n\"Snippet for creating a new event on Facebook using Splinter\"), available at\nGithub).\n\nNow we see the iframe element on screen and we can finally upload the\npicture. Imagine we have a variable that contains the path of the picture (and\nnot a file object, StringIO, or something like this), and this variable name\nis picture_path, this is the code we need:\nwith browser.get_iframe('upload_pic_frame') as frame:\n    frame.attach_file('pic', picture_path)\n    time.sleep(10)\n\nSplinter provides the get_iframe method that changes the context and returns\nanother objet to interact with the content of the frame. So we call the\nattach_file method, who also receives two strings: the first is the name of\nthe input element and the second is the absolute path to the file being sent.\nFacebook also uploads the picture asynchronously, but there’s no way to wait\nsome element to appear on screen, so I just put Python to sleep 10 seconds on\nlast line.\nAfter finish all these steps, we can finally click on “Create Event” button and\nasserts that Facebook created it:\nbrowser.find_by_css('label.uiButton input[type=\"submit\"]').first.click()\ntitle = browser.find_by_css('h1 span').first.text\nassert title == 'Splinter sprint'\n\nAfter create an event, Facebook redirects the browser to the event page, so we\ncan check if it really happened by asserting the header of the page. That’s\nwhat the code above does: in the new event page, it click on submit button, and\nafter the redirect, get the text of a span element and asserts that this text\nequals to “Splinter sprint”.\nThat is it!

This is how the structure is going to look\nlike:\n.\n├── SpecRunner.html\n├── lib\n│   ├── jasmine-1.0.2\n│   │   ├── MIT.LICENSE\n│   │   ├── jasmine-html.js\n│   │   ├── jasmine.css\n│   │   └── jasmine.js\n│   └── jquery-1.6.1.min.js\n├── spec\n│   └── ZebrafySpec.js\n└── src\n    └── jquery.zebrafy.js\n\nYou can create the files jquery.zebrafy.js and ZebrafySpec.js, but\nremember: it is BDD, we need to describe\nthe behavior first, then write the code. So let’s start writing the specs in\nZebrafySpec.js file using Jasmine. If you are familiar with\nRSpec syntax, it’s easy to understand how to write spec\nwiths Jasmine, if you aren’t, here is the clue: Jasmine is a lib with some\nfunctions used for writing tests in an easier way. I’m going to explain each\nfunction “on demmand”, when we need something, we learn how to use it! ;)\nFirst of all, we need to start a new test suite. Jasmine provides the\ndescribe function for that, this function receives a string and another\nfunction (a callback). The string describes the test suite and the function is\na callback that delimites the scope of the test suite. Here is the Zebrafy\nsuite:\ndescribe('Zebrafy', function () {\n\n});\n\nLet’s start describing the behavior we want to get from the plugin. The most\nbasic is: we want different CSS classes for odd an even lines in a table.\nJasmine provides the it function for writing the tests. It also receives a\nstring and a callback: the string is a description for the test and the\ncallback is the function executed as test. Here is the very first test:\nit('should apply classes zebrafy-odd and zebrafy-even to each other table lines', function () {\n    var table = $(\"#zebra-table\");\n    table.zebrafy();\n    expect(table).toBeZebrafyied();\n});\n\nOkay, here we go: in the first line of the callback, we are using jQuery to\nselect a table using the #zebra-table selector, which will look up for a\ntable with the ID attribute equals to “zebra-table”, but we don’t have this\ntable in the DOM. What about add a new table to the DOM in a hook executed\nbefore the test run and remove the table in another hook that runs after the\ntest? Jasmine provide two functions: beforeEach and afterEach. Both\nfunctions receive a callback function to be executed and, as the names suggest,\nthe beforeEach callback is called before each test run, and the afterEach\ncallback is called after the test run. Here are the hooks:\nbeforeEach(function () {\n    $('&lt;table id=\"zebra-table\"&gt;&lt;/table&gt;').appendTo('body');\n    for (var i=0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n        $('&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;').append('&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;').append('&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;').append('&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;').appendTo('#zebra-table');\n    };\n});\n\nafterEach(function () {\n    $(\"#zebra-table\").remove();\n});\n\nThe beforeEach callback uses jQuery to create a table with 10 rows and 3\ncolumns and add it to the DOM. In afterEach callback, we just remove that\ntable using jQuery again. Okay, now the table exists, let’s go back to the\ntest:\nit('should apply classes zebrafy-odd and zebrafy-even to each other table lines', function () {\n    var table = $(\"#zebra-table\");\n    table.zebrafy();\n    expect(table).toBeZebrafyied();\n});\n\nIn the second line, we call our plugin, that is not ready yet, so let’s forward\nto the next line, where we used the expect function. Jasmine provides this\nfunction, that receives an object and executes a matcher against it, there is\na lot of built-in matchers on Jasmine, but toBeZebrafyied is not a built-in\nmatcher. Here is where we know another Jasmine feature: the capability to write\ncustom matchers, but how to do this? You can call the beforeEach again, and\nuse the addMatcher method of Jasmine object:\nbeforeEach(function () {\n    this.addMatchers({\n        toBeZebrafyied: function() {\n            var isZebrafyied = true;\n\n            this.actual.find(\"tr:even\").each(function (index, tr) {\n                isZebrafyied = $(tr).hasClass('zebrafy-odd') === false &amp;&amp; $(tr).hasClass('zebrafy-even');\n                if (!isZebrafyied) {\n                    return;\n                };\n            });\n\n            this.actual.find(\"tr:odd\").each(function (index, tr) {\n                isZebrafyied = $(tr).hasClass('zebrafy-odd') &amp;&amp; $(tr).hasClass('zebrafy-even') === false;\n                if (!isZebrafyied) {\n                    return;\n                };\n            });\n\n            return isZebrafyied;\n        }\n    });\n});\n\nThe method addMatchers receives an object where each property is a matcher.\nYour matcher can receive arguments if you want. The object being matched can be\naccessed using this.actual, so here is what the method above does: it takes\nall odd &lt;tr&gt; elements of the table (this.actual) and check if them have the\nCSS class zebrafy-odd and don’t have the CSS class zebrafy-even, then do\nthe same checking with even &lt;tr&gt; lines.\nNow that we have wrote the test, it’s time to write the plugin. Here some\njQuery code:\n(function ($) {\n    $.fn.zebrafy = function () {\n        this.find(\"tr:even\").addClass(\"zebrafy-even\");\n        this.find(\"tr:odd\").addClass(\"zebrafy-odd\");\n    };\n})(jQuery);\n\nI’m not going to explain how to implement a jQuery\nplugin neither what are those\nbrackets on\nfunction,\nthis post aims to show how to use Jasmine to test jQuery plugins.\nBy convention, jQuery plugins are “chainable”, so let’s make sure the zebrafy\nplugin is chainable using a spec:\nit('zebrafy should be chainable', function() {\n    var table = $(\"#zebra-table\");\n    table.zebrafy().addClass('black-bg');\n    expect(table.hasClass('black-bg')).toBeTruthy();\n});\n\nAs you can see, we used the built-in matcher toBeTruthy, which asserts that\nan object or expression is true. All we need to do is return the jQuery\nobject in the plugin and the test will pass:\n(function ($) {\n    $.fn.zebrafy = function () {\n        return this.each(function (index, table) {\n            $(table).find(\"tr:even\").addClass(\"zebrafy-even\");\n            $(table).find(\"tr:odd\").addClass(\"zebrafy-odd\");\n        });\n    };\n})(jQuery);\n\nSo, the plugin is tested and ready to release! :) You can check the entire code\nand test with more spec in a GitHub\nrepository.\n","id":"https://blog.fsouza.dev/testing-jquery-plugins-with-jasmine/","title":"Testing jQuery plugins with Jasmine"},"https://blog.fsouza.dev/using-juju-to-orchestrate-centos-based/":{"body":"Earlier this week I had the opportunity to meet Kyle\nMacDonald, head of Ubuntu\nCloud, during FISL, and he\nwas surprised when we told him we are using Juju with\nCentOS at\nGlobo.com. Then I decided to write this post explaining how we came up with a\npatched version of Juju that\nallows us to have CentOS clouds managed by Juju.\nFor those who doesn't know Juju, it's a service orchestration tool, focused on\ndevops \"development method\". It allows\nyou to deploy services on clouds, local machine and even bare metal machines\n(using Canonical's MAAS).\nIt's based on charms and very\nstraightforward to use. Here is a very basic set of commands with which you can\ndeploy a Wordpress related to a MySQL service:\n% juju bootstrap\n% juju deploy mysql\n% juju deploy wordpress\n% juju add-relation wordpress mysql\n% juju expose wordpress\n\nThese commands will boostrap the environment, setting up a bootstrap machine\nwhich will manage your services; deploy mysql and wordpress instances; add a\nrelation between them; and expose the wordpress port. The voilà, we have a\nwordpress deployed, and ready to serve our posts. Amazing, huh?\nBut there is an issue: although you can install the juju command line tool in\nalmost any OS (including Mac OS), right now you are able do deploy only\nUbuntu-based services (you must use an Ubuntu instance or container).\nTo change this behavior, and enable Juju to spawn CentOS instances (and\ncontainers, if you have a CentOS lxc template), we need to develop and apply\nsome changes to Juju and\ncloud-init. Juju uses cloud-init\nto spawn machines with proper dependencies set up, and it's based on modules.\nAll we need to do, is add a module able to install rpm packages using yum.\ncloud-init modules are Python modules that starts with cc_ and implement a\nhandle function (for example, a module called \"yum_packages\" would be written\nto a file called cc_yum_packages.py). So, here is the code for the module\nyum_packages:\nimport subprocess\nimport traceback\n\nfrom cloudinit import CloudConfig, util\n\nfrequency = CloudConfig.per_instance\n\ndef yum_install(packages):\n    cmd = [\"yum\", \"--quiet\", \"--assumeyes\", \"install\"]\n    cmd.extend(packages)\n    subprocess.check_call(cmd)\n\ndef handle(_name, cfg, _cloud, log, args):\n    pkglist = util.get_cfg_option_list_or_str(cfg, \"packages\", [])\n\n    if pkglist:\n        try:\n            yum_install(pkglist)\n        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n            log.warn(\"Failed to install yum packages: %s\" % pkglist)\n            log.debug(traceback.format_exc())\n            raise\n\n    return True\n\nThe module installs all packages listed in cloud-init yaml file. If we want to install emacs-nox package, we would write this yaml file and use it as user data in the instance:\n#cloud-config\nmodules:\n - yum_packages\npackages: [emacs-nox]\n\ncloud-init already works on Fedora, with Python 2.7, but to work on CentOS 6, with Python 2.6, it needs a patch:\n--- cloudinit/util.py 2012-05-22 12:18:21.000000000 -0300\n+++ cloudinit/util.py 2012-05-31 12:44:24.000000000 -0300\n@@ -227,7 +227,7 @@\n         stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE)\n     out, err = sp.communicate(input_)\n     if sp.returncode is not 0:\n-        raise subprocess.CalledProcessError(sp.returncode, args, (out, err))\n+        raise subprocess.CalledProcessError(sp.returncode, args)\n     return(out, err)\n\nI've packet up this module and this patch in a RPM\npackage that must be\npre-installed in the lxc template and AMI images.
