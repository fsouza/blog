functions\n\nMap\nFilter\nFold\nFlatMap\n\n\nSlicing streams\nPutting it all together in a realistic example\n\nAnother more interesting example\n\n\nWhy not methods?\nFeedback\n\n\n\nNote 1: this is an experiment with an upcoming change in Go's type system.\nIf you need something like what's described in the post in the real world,\nuse channels, or something like RxGo.\nNote 2: I originally started this post in August and almost abandoned it,\nbut figured it's still a useful exploration of an important upcoming feature\nuse channels, or something like RxGo.\n\nGo 1.18 will support generics, and I decided I would give it a shot. I've been\nplaying with the idea of representing streams with\nchannels and higher order functions that\noperate on those channels, allowing processes to execute on streams of data\nsomewhat-lazily. This is 100% a toy project and a production-ready version of\n\"lazy/generic streams\" will likely come in some future release of\nRxGo.\nStill, while working on a solution to get this working with channels, I figured\nwe could also try to get it working in a more traditional representation, at\nleast in functional languages: streams can be represented by a pair - a value\nand a function to generate the next value.\nI started with a question: with generics, is the Go type-system expressive\nenough to represent such streams. And how bad would it look without Ocaml's or\nHaskell's type inference capabilities? Turns out we can represent streams,\nand the limited type-inference makes it a bit annoying, but it isn't too bad!\nThe basic type definition\nFirst, let's start with the type definition. Like mentioned above, we want to\nrepresent a stream of T as a nullable pair of some value T and a function that\nproduces the next value of the stream T. A nil stream represents an empty\nstream.\nGo doesn't directly support pairs, so we're going to use a struct here:\ntype Stream[T any] struct {\n\tValue T\n\tNext  func() *Stream[T]\n}\n\nAnd we'll represent streams as pointers to that struct, which takes care of the\nnullable part.\nIt looks like a linked-list, but since we want to be able to represent a\npotentially infinite linked list, instead of making Next a pointer to Stream,\nwe make it a function that returns the pointer, and lazily execute that\nfunction as needed.\nCreating streams\nFirst, let's start with some very basic streams: an empty stream, and a\nsingleton stream (that contains a single element). We'll use helper functions\nto implement those:\nfunc Empty[T any]() *Stream[T] {\n\treturn nil\n}\n\nfunc Singleton[T any](element T) *Stream[T] {\n\treturn &amp;Stream[T]{\n\t\tValue: element,\n\t\tNext:  Empty[T],\n\t}\n}\n\nA more interesting helper function is a function that takes a slice and returns\na stream with the elements of that slice:\nfunc FromSlice[T any](items []T) *Stream[T] {\n\tif len(items) == 0 {\n\t\treturn nil\n\t}\n\treturn &amp;Stream[T]{\n\t\tValue: items[0],\n\t\tNext: func() *Stream[T] {\n\t\t\treturn FromSlice(items[1:])\n\t\t},\n\t}\n}\n\nTo keep the context around of where we are in the slice as the stream is\nconsumed, we introduce a helper function that takes the index that we want to\nconsume in the slice, and FromSlice invokes that helper function starting at\nindex 0. The stream becomes nil as soon as the index grows too large,\nindicating that we finished iterating over the slice.\nInfinite streams\nUsing a slice is no fun, we probably want to be able to implement streams that\nare potentially infinite. For example, a stream of natural numbers could be\nrepresented as follows:\nfunc nat(start int) *Stream[int] {\n\treturn &amp;Stream[int]{\n\t\tValue: start,\n\t\tNext: func() *Stream[int] {\n\t\t\treturn nat(start + 1)\n\t\t},\n\t}\n}\n\nHere is where the limitation with Go's type inference starts to show: since it\ncan't infer return types, we have to manually specify Stream[int] in multiple\nplaces.\nNote how we never return nil in the function above, indicating that this\nstream doesn't really end.\nManipulating streams\nNow that we know how to create them, we need to understand how to manipulate\nthem to accomplish something useful. Two useful helper functions, useful for\ndebugging and what not, are Iter and ToSlice: Iter takes a stream and a\nfunction, and iterates over the stream, invoking the function for each element,\nwhile ToSlice converts a stream to a slice.\nHere's Iter:\nfunc Iter[T any](stream *Stream[T], f func(T)) {\n\tfor ; stream != nil; stream = stream.Next() {\n\t\tf(stream.Value)\n\t}\n}\n\nAnd here's ToSlice, built on top of Iter:\nfunc ToSlice[T any](stream *Stream[T]) []T {\n\tvar result []T\n\tIter(stream, func(value T) {\n\t\tresult = append(result, value)\n\t})\n\treturn result\n}\n\n(folks who are paying attention will probably suggest that we use something\nlike Fold instead of Iter to implement ToSlice, we'll get there).\nAnd now that we have Iter and an infinite stream, we should try to use it\nmaybe? :)\nfunc main() {\n\tIter(nat(0), func(v int) {\n\t\tfmt.Println(v)\n\t})\n}\n\nThis is a very fancy way of making an infinite loop :)\nHigher-order functions\nHigher-order functions make streams more interesting. There are many possible\nhigh-order functions, but we'll explore some common names here: Map, Filter\nand Fold (Fold may also be called Reduce in other contexts). Then we'll\ndo a fun one with FlatMap.\n\nNote: different from actual lists/arrays, with streams one can't\nimplement Map or Filter using Fold, as Fold always consumes the\nstream.\n\nThe interesting thing with streams is that functions such as Filter and Map\ndon't do any computation unless needed: streams are lazy by nature, and actual\ncomputations only happen when they're consumed.\nMap\nMap takes a stream of type T and a function from T to U and returns a\nstream of U. Here's the implementation of Map:\nfunc Map[T, U any](stream *Stream[T], f func(T) U) *Stream[U] {\n\tif stream == nil {\n\t\treturn nil\n\t}\n\treturn &amp;Stream[U]{\n\t\tValue: f(stream.Value),\n\t\tNext: func() *Stream[U] {\n\t\t\treturn Map(stream.Next(), f)\n\t\t},\n\t}\n}\n\nHow can we use Map? A simple/stupid example would be to double all numbers\nfrom the nat stream to get a stream of even numbers:\nfunc main() {\n\tevens := Map(nat(0), func(v int) int {\n\t\treturn v * 2\n\t})\n\tIter(evens, func(v int) {\n\t\tfmt.Println(v)\n\t})\n}\n\nFilter\nFilter takes a stream of type T and a predicate function from T to bool\nand returns a new stream of T, containing only the elements of the original\nstream for which the given predicate returns true. Here's the implementation\nof filter:\nfunc Filter[T any](stream *Stream[T], f func(T) bool) *Stream[T] {\n\tfor ; stream != nil; stream = stream.Next() {\n\t\tif f(stream.Value) {\n\t\t\treturn &amp;Stream[T]{\n\t\t\t\tValue: stream.Value,\n\t\t\t\tNext: func() *Stream[T] {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn Filter(stream.Next(), f)\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn stream\n}\n\nSince a non-nil Stream is required to have a valid element, Filter isn't\ntotally lazy, as it has to consume the source stream until the predicate p\nreturns true. Here's how we can get a stream of even numbers using Filter\ninstead of Map:\nfunc main() {\n\tevens := Filter(nat(0), func(v int) bool {\n\t\treturn v%2 == 0\n\t})\n\tIter(evens, func(v int) {\n\t\tfmt.Println(v)\n\t})\n}\n\nFold\nFold can be used to eagerly fold the elements of a stream into some other\nvalue. For example, if you have a finite stream of integers, you could use\nFold to find the largest, the smallest or the sum of all elements in the\nstream.\nSince Fold is eager, it can't really operate on infinite streams, as that\nwould loop forever. Let's look at the implementation of Fold:\nfunc Fold[T, U any](stream *Stream[T], init U, f func(U, T) U) U {\n\tacc := init\n\tfor ; stream != nil; stream = stream.Next() {\n\t\tacc = f(acc, stream.Value)\n\t}\n\treturn acc\n}\n\nAnd here's an implementation of ToSlice that uses Fold instead of Iter:\nfunc ToSlice[T any](stream *Stream[T]) []T {\n\treturn Fold(stream, []T{}, func(acc []T, elm T) []T {\n\t\treturn append(acc, elm)\n\t})\n}\n\nFlatMap\nFlatMap works like Map, but instead of taking a function from T to U,\nit takes a function from T to Stream[U]. In order to implement FlatMap,\nwe'll first implement another useful function: Append, which takes two\nstreams s1 and s2 and returns a stream that will have all elements from\ns1, then all elements from s2. Here's the code for both Append and\nFlatMap:\nfunc Append[T any](stream1 *Stream[T], stream2 *Stream[T]) *Stream[T] {\n\tif stream1 == nil {\n\t\treturn stream2\n\t}\n\treturn &amp;Stream[T]{\n\t\tValue: stream1.Value,\n\t\tNext: func() *Stream[T] {\n\t\t\treturn Append(stream1.Next(), stream2)\n\t\t},\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc FlatMap[T, U any](stream *Stream[T], f func(T) *Stream[U]) *Stream[U] {\n\tif stream == nil {\n\t\treturn nil\n\t}\n\treturn Append(f(stream.Value), FlatMap(stream.Next(), f))\n}\n\nOne simple-ish example is taking a stream of strings and turning that into a\nstream of runes:\nvar s *Stream[string] = ...\nFlatMap(s, func(v string) *Stream[rune] {\n\treturn FromSlice([]rune(v))\n})\n\nSlicing streams\nOn top of filtering, mapping, appending and others, one may want to combine\nmultiple streams (using Append declared above), or get some elements of a\nstream, or drop some items from a stream. For that, let's look at how we'd\nimplement some other helper functions:\n\nTake(s Stream[T], n int) Stream[T]: given stream s, returns a new stream\nwith at most n elements.\nTakeWhile(s Stream[T], p func(T) bool) Stream[T]: given stream s and a\npredicate p, returns a new stream that will have elements from s as long\nas p returns true\nTakeUntil(s Stream[T], p func(T) bool) Stream[T]: like TakeWhile, but the\noutput stream will have elements from s until p returns true.\n\nHere's the source for Take, TakeWhile and TakeUntil:\nfunc Take[T any](stream *Stream[T], n uint) *Stream[T] {\n\tif n == 0 || stream == nil {\n\t\treturn nil\n\t}\n\treturn &amp;Stream[T]{\n\t\tValue: stream.Value,\n\t\tNext: func() *Stream[T] {\n\t\t\treturn Take(stream.Next(), n-1)\n\t\t},\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc TakeWhile[T any](stream *Stream[T], f func(T) bool) *Stream[T] {\n\tif stream == nil {\n\t\treturn nil\n\t}\n\tif f(stream.Value) {\n\t\treturn &amp;Stream[T]{\n\t\t\tValue: stream.Value,\n\t\t\tNext: func() *Stream[T] {\n\t\t\t\treturn TakeWhile(stream.Next(), f)\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn nil\n}\n\nfunc TakeUntil[T any](stream *Stream[T], f func(T) bool) *Stream[T] {\n\treturn TakeWhile(stream, func(v T) bool { return !f(v) })\n}\n\nNotice how TakeUntil is simply implemented in terms of TakeWhile. As a\nmatter of fact, Take could also be implemented with TakeWhile and a\nclosure:\nfunc Take[T any](stream *Stream[T], n uint) *Stream[T] {\n\treturn TakeWhile(stream, func(T) bool {\n\t\tif n == 0 {\n\t\t\treturn false\n\t\t}\n\t\tn--\n\t\treturn true\n\t})\n}\n\nPutting it all together in a realistic example\nLet's do a very simple REPL style application: it has a shell where we can\nenter commands, and those commands will have some side-effect. Let's implement\na poor man memcached that operates via stdin, and\nsupports three commands set, get and del (which will set a key-value\npair, get the value of a key and delete a key, respectively). We want to be\nable to have two separate layers: one for parsing and another one for executing\ncommands, and we want to be able to send commands from stdin to the execution\nlayer.\nThis is an extremely simple example that doesn't really need generics (it's\nstringly-typed :D), but should give an idea of how functional streams can be\nused.\nFirst, let's introduce a helper function that allow us to generate a lines\nstream from an io.Reader:\nfunc FromReader(r io.Reader) *Stream[string] {\n\treturn fromReader(bufio.NewReader(r))\n}\n\nfunc fromReader(r *bufio.Reader) *Stream[string] {\n\tline, isPrefix, err := r.ReadLine()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil\n\t}\n\tparts := []string{string(line)}\n\tfor isPrefix {\n\t\tline, isPrefix, err = r.ReadLine()\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn nil\n\t\t}\n\t\tparts = append(parts, string(line))\n\t}\n\treturn &amp;Stream[string]{\n\t\tValue: strings.Join(parts, \"\"),\n\t\tNext: func() *Stream[string] {\n\t\t\treturn fromReader(r)\n\t\t},\n\t}\n}\n\n\nNote: that we're eating errors here, just another demonstration that you\nshouldn't do this in production, at least not the way it's described in this\nblog post :)\nThe code below will also not handle any errors. Don't do this at home.\n\nNow that we have that function, we can create our \"database\" instance, loop\nthrough the input and execute commands:\nfunc ProcessCommands(input io.Reader, output io.Writer) {\n\ts := stream.FromReader(input)\n\tstream.Fold(s, NewDB(output), func(db *DB, line string) *DB {\n\t\tcmd := strings.Fields(line)\n\t\tdb.Execute(cmd[0], cmd[1:])\n\t\treturn db\n\t})\n}\n\n(for runnable code, checkout the GitHub\nrepository)\nAnother more interesting example\nA less realistic, but interesting example is taking a stream of numbers from\nstdin, parse them, and sum all the prime numbers. This requires using the\nhelper FromReader, Map to parse the number, Filter to discard non-prime\nnumbers and Fold to sum the filtered values. Notice that this is stdin, so\nvalues are getting piped through as they are read from stdin.\nHere's what that \"pipeline\" looks like:\nfunc main() {\n\tstdin := stream.FromReader(os.Stdin)\n\tnumbers := stream.Map(stdin, parseLine)\n\tprimes := stream.Filter(numbers, isPrime)\n\tsum := stream.Fold(primes, 0, sum)\n\tfmt.Println(sum)\n}\n\n(again, for runnable code, checkout the GitHub repo)\nWhy not methods?\nTL;DR: Go doesn't really support it. It may in the\nfuture.\nOne thing one may notice from the example above is that using functions makes\nthe code quite verbose, we have to introduce variables for intermediary streams\n(or we could nest function calls).\nFunctional languages get away with that by having some sort of function\ncomposition or using pipe operators / threading macros. But in more\nobject-oriented languages, methods are used, which is a better fit for Go. So the code below:\nstdin := stream.FromReader(os.Stdin)\nnumbers := stream.Map(stdin, parseLine)\nprimes := stream.Filter(numbers, isPrime)\nsum := stream.Fold(primes, 0, sum)\n\nCould become something like:\nsum := stream.FromReader(os.Stdin).Map(parseLine).Filter(isPrime).Fold(0, sum)\n\nWhy can't we do that in Go? The problem is that methods can't really be generic\nin Go, it's not currently supported by the generics implementation, which means\nthe Map method in the pipeline above cannot be implemented. It's an issues\nwith how methods are used for structural subtyping &amp; interfaces, so it may be\ncomplicated to address or not happen at hall. See the issue in the Go issue\ntracker for more details!\nFeedback\nDo you have any feedback? Questions? Concerns? Wanna fix a typo?

One of the first\nissues I ran into was performance: saving files became deadly slow, to the\npoint where I gave up and disabled format-on-save.\nThe thing is: prettier is known to be a fast code formatter, and I didn't have\nthe issue before, so what's the  problem here? Is Neovim making prettier\nslower? Is coc-prettier doing some magic shit?\nBefore we start looking into this, let's see how prettier behaves when\nformatting a somewhat large TypeScript file:\n％ wc -l sample.ts\n     586 sample.ts\n％ time npx prettier -w sample.ts\nsample.ts 332ms\n        0.85 real         0.91 user         0.11 sys\n\nIt's interesting that prettier reports that it took 332ms to format the file,\nbut time reports that the whole process took 850ms. Who's lying?\nLet's take a look at multiple files:\n％ wc -l sample*.ts\n     330 sample1.ts\n     718 sample2.ts\n     655 sample3.ts\n    2511 sample4.ts\n     601 sample5.ts\n    4815 total\n％ time npx prettier -w sample1.ts\nsample1.ts 290ms\n        0.93 real         0.88 user         0.11 sys\n％ time npx prettier -w sample2.ts\nsample2.ts 358ms\n        1.02 real         1.04 user         0.12 sys\n％ time npx prettier -w sample3.ts\nsample3.ts 330ms\n        0.97 real         0.95 user         0.13 sys\n％ time npx prettier -w sample4.ts\nsample4.ts 648ms\n        1.27 real         1.48 user         0.13 sys\n％ time npx prettier -w sample5.ts\nsample5.ts 375ms\n        1.00 real         1.00 user         0.12 sys\n\nNotice how formatting sample2.ts and sample4.ts takes more than 1 second in\ntotal! Also interesting is the fact that even though sample1.ts is less the\nhalf the size of sample2.ts, formatting sample2.ts does not take twice as\nmuch time.\nWho cares?!\nOK, let's take a step back and reflect: who cares if prettier is slow to format\nmy files? I could run it on a git hook or something like that and not even\nnotice.\nAs I mentioned before, I was running format-on-save in Neovim, with a simple\nsetup, not very fancy:\nautocmd BufWritePre *.ts execute \"silent %!npx prettier --stdin-filepath '\" . expand('%:p') . \"'\"\n\n(it was a bit fancier than that, but not by much)\nSo, imagine you're using Neovim and every time you save the file you have to\nwait 1 second. You'd be mad, right?! There must be a better way...\n\"My Visual Studio Code doesn't take a second to format-on-save, your Vim is trash\"\nTo be fair, coc-prettier was pretty fast too. How is that even possible?\nLet's go back to our sample files, but this time let's see what prettier does\nif we pass all 5 files to it instead of invoking it 5 times:\n％ time npx prettier -w *.ts\nsample1.ts 248ms\nsample2.ts 205ms\nsample3.ts 110ms\nsample4.ts 327ms\nsample5.ts 79ms\n        1.61 real         2.09 user         0.15 sys\n\nThis time sample2.ts is faster than sample1.ts, even though it's twice as\nlarge! What's going on? Turns out prettier is slow to\nstart, both because of\noverhead introduced by node.js and prettier itself (it has tons of plugins and\ndependencies).\nAnd how is it fast to format-on-save using VSCode/coc-prettier? Simple:\nboth coc-prettier and Visual Studio Code are long-running node.js processes,\nwhich host prettier as a library, therefore paying the initialization cost\nonce.\nThe solution is simple: we need a long-running node.js process! If you read\nthrough the issue about slow startups in prettier, someone suggests using\nprettier_d, but after looking at\nhow large that project was, I was a bit scared.\nDoing some more research, I found\neslint_d.js, which solves a similar\nissue for eslint, by introducing a daemon which supports binding on a TCP\nsocket! And the author of eslint_d.js extracted its core functionality in a\nlibrary called core_d.js. So I figured\nI could combine that library with prettier and make\nprettierd, a TCP-enabled daemon for\nformatting code using prettier!\nInstalling and starting prettierd\nThe code for prettierd is pretty boring, as it is basically a tiny wrapper\naround core_d to invoke the proper prettier functions whenever the server\nreceives a \"request\". The two important things to know about are:\n\nYou can install it with npm and start it with prettierd start:\n\n％ npm install -g @fsouza/prettierd\n％ prettierd start\n\nAlternatively you can do both things with npx:\n％ npx -p @fsouza/prettierd prettierd start\n\n\nWhen it starts, prettierd writes a file with its port number and token\n\n％ cat ~/.prettierd\n53561 cb2ad753df0aca85\n\nThis means that prettierd is running on port 53561 and we can use the token\ncb2ad753df0aca85 in our requests to format our source code.\ncore_d's protocol is pretty simple:\n&lt;token&gt; &lt;working-dir&gt; &lt;file-name&gt;\\n\n&lt;file-content&gt;\n\nFor example, we can use netcat:\n％ echo \"cb2ad753df0aca85 $PWD sample2.ts\" | cat - sample2.ts | /usr/bin/time nc localhost 53561 &gt;sample2-formatted.ts\n        0.14 real         0.00 user         0.00 sys\n\nRemember how formatting sample2.ts took over 1 second? Not anymore. :)\nIntegrating Neovim with prettierd\nUsing netcat is great and we could probably write a shell script that we could\nuse in our (fun fact: someone else did this, check the bonus section!), but\nNeovim is powerful enough to connect directly to the TCP server.\nHow? Neovim has an event loop, which is implemented using\nlibuv. libuv is probably the best event loop there in the\nwild, but don't quote me :) Besides shipping the event loop and all the libuv\ncode, Neovim also bundles luv and expose the\nloop as a Lua API, so we can use vim.loop.&lt;nice-async-things&gt;! Taylor\nThompson has written an amazing post about the using libuv in\nNeovim, go check it out if you're curious :)\nAmong the utilities provided by libuv, there's a tcp module which includes both\na TCP client and a TCP server! In our case we want to use a client, so we\ninvoke the tcp_connect function:\nlocal callback = ...\nlocal port = 53561\nlocal token = 'cb2ad753df0aca85'\nlocal client = vim.loop.new_tcp()\nvim.loop.tcp_connect(client, '127.0.0.1', port, callback)\n\nSince this is async world, we need to pass a callback that gets executed\nwhenever the connection happens (or in case something goes wrong). So the first\nthing we do in our callback is check for errors, which looks familiar for Go\ndevelopers:\nlocal callback = function(err)\n  if err then\n    error(err)\n  end\n\n  ...\nend\n\nIf there are no errors, it means we can send the contents of our file to the\nremote server. We have the port and the token, but we also need the contents of\nthe buffer. So let's grab the contents of the current buffer and send that to\nthe server, then read back the response and write it back to the buffer! This\ntime I'll include the entire implementation of the callback, with some inline\ncomments:\nlocal callback = function(err)\n  if err then\n    error(err)\n  end\n\n  -- grab the contents of the buffer and add first row to match core_d's protocol\n  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()\n  local first_line = string.format('%s %s %s', token, vim.loop.cwd(), 'sample2.js')\n  local lines = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(bufnr, 0, -1, true)\n  table.insert(lines, 1, first_line)\n\n  -- start reading the response\n  local response = ''\n  vim.loop.read_start(client, function(read_err, chunk)\n    -- check if there was any error reading data back, if so, close the\n    -- connection and report the error.\n    if read_err then\n      vim.loop.close(client)\n      error('failed to read data from prettierd: ' .. read_err)\n    end\n\n    -- libuv will call this callback with no data and no error when it's done,\n    -- so if there's data, concatenate it into the final response. Otherwise it\n    -- means we're done, so invoke the `write_to_buf` to write the data back.\n    if chunk then\n      response = response .. chunk\n    else\n      vim.loop.close(client)\n      write_to_buf(response, bufnr)\n    end\n  end)\n\n  -- write the request\n  vim.loop.write(client, table.concat(lines, '\\n'))\n\n  -- signal to the server that we're done writing the request\n  vim.loop.shutdown(client)\nend\n\nAnd here's a simple implementation of write_to_buf. The trickiest bit is\nerror handling: the way errors are reported isn't great, but it's acceptable:\nif prettier fails, the last line contains a message in the format # exit &lt;code&gt; ....\nlocal function write_to_buf(data, bufnr)\n  local new_lines = vim.split(data, '\\n')\n\n  -- check for errors\n  if string.find(new_lines[#new_lines], '^# exit %d+') then\n    error(string.format('failed to format with prettier: %s', data))\n  end\n\n  -- write contents\n  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, 0, -1, false, new_lines)\nend\n\nNow you can throw all of that in a format() function and invoke it on write!\n\nNote: the code here is a simplified version of what I actually use. For\nthe actual config, including automatic process management, retries, error\nhandling and cursor positioning, checkout\nprettierd.lua\nin my dotfiles repo.\n\nNot just TypeScript and JavaScript\nUsers of prettier are aware of this, but prettier is not just about JavaScript\nand TypeScript, it can be used with many other file formats, including HTML,\nMarkdown, CSS, YAML, JSON and others. Check the parser configuration in\nprettier docs for a full\nlist, and keep in mind that additional file types can be added via plugins!\nBonus: using it on the command line with prettierme\nIf you want to use Vim instead of Neovim, or don't want to maintain a TCP\nclient in your editor configuration, you can leverage Ruy Adorno's\nprettierme to use a command line\ninterface that is more similar to the standard prettier interface. prettierme\nis basically a wrapper around our netcat example.\nFeedback\nDo you have any feedback?

So, let’s download and extract the latest stable version\n(1.0.9) from nginx website:\n% curl -O http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.0.9.tar.gz\n% tar -xzf nginx-1.0.9.tar.gz\n\nOnce you have extracted it, just configure, compile and install:\n% ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx --user=nginx --group=nginx\n% make\n% [sudo] make install\n\nAs you can see, we provided the /opt/nginx to configure, make sure the /opt\ndirectory exists. Also, make sure that there is a user and a group called\nnginx, if they don’t exist, add them:\n% [sudo] adduser --system --no-create-home --disabled-login --disabled-password --group nginx\n\nAfter that, you can start nginx using the command line below:\n% [sudo] /opt/nginx/sbin/nginx\n\n\nLinode provides an init\nscript that uses\nstart-stop-daemon, you might want\nto use it.\n\nnginx configuration\nnginx comes with a default nginx.conf file, let’s change it to reflect the\nfollowing configuration requirements:\n\nnginx should start workers with the nginx user\nnginx should have two worker processes\nthe PID should be stored in the /opt/nginx/log/nginx.pid file\nnginx must have an access log in /opt/nginx/logs/access.log\nthe configuration for the Django project we’re going to develop should be\nversioned with the entire code, so it must be included in the nginx.conf\nfile (assume that the library project is in the directory /opt/projects).\n\nSo here is the nginx.conf for the requirements above:\nuser  nginx;\nworker_processes  2;\n\npid logs/nginx.pid;\n\nevents {\n    worker_connections  1024;\n}\n\nhttp {\n    include       mime.types;\n    default_type  application/octet-stream;\n\n    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] \"$request\" '\n                     '$status $body_bytes_sent \"$http_referer\" '\n                     '\"$http_user_agent\" \"$http_x_forwarded_for\"';\n\n    access_log  logs/access.log  main;\n\n    sendfile           on;\n    keepalive_timeout  65;\n\n    include /opt/projects/showcase/nginx.conf;\n}\n\nNow we just need to write the configuration for our Django project. I’m using\nan old sample project written while I was working at\nGiran: the name is lojas giranianas, a nonsense\nportuguese joke with a famous brazilian store. It’s an unfinished showcase of\nproducts, it’s like an e-commerce project, but it can’t sell, so it’s just a\nproduct catalog. The code is available at\nGithub. The nginx.conf file\nfor the repository is here:\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name localhost;\n\n    charset utf-8;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP   $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header    Host        $http_host;\n        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;\n    }\n\n    location /static {\n        root /opt/projects/showcase/;\n        expires 1d;\n    }\n}\n\nThe server listens on port 80, responds for the localhost hostname (read\nmore about the Host\nheader). The\nlocation /static directive says that nginx will serve the static files of the\nproject. It also includes an expires directive for caching control. The\nlocation / directive makes a proxy_pass, forwarding all requisitions to an\nupstream server listening on port 8000, this server is the subject of the next\npost of the series: the Green Unicorn (gunicorn) server.\nNot only the HTTP request itself is forwarded to the gunicorn server, but also\nsome headers, that helps to properly deal with the request:\n\nX-Real-IP: forwards the remote address to the upstream server, so it can\nknow the real IP of the user. When nginx forwards the request to gunicorn,\nwithout this header, all gunicorn will know is that there is a request coming\nfrom localhost (or wherever the nginx server is), the remote address is\nalways the IP address of the machine where nginx is running (who actually\nmake the request to gunicorn)\nHost: the Host header is forwarded so gunicorn can treat different\nrequests for different hosts. Without this header, it will be impossible to\nGunicorn to have these constraints\nX-Forwarded-For: also known as XFF, this header provide more precise\ninformation about the real IP who makes the request. Imagine there are 10\nproxies between the user machine and your webserver, the XFF header will all\nthese proxies comma separated. In order to not turn a proxy into an\nanonymizer, it’s a good practice to always forward this header.\n\nSo that is it, in the next post we are going to install and run gunicorn. In\nother posts, we’ll see how to make automated deploys using\nFabric, and some tricks on caching (using the\nproxy_cache directive and integrating Django, nginx and\nmemcached).\nSee you in next posts.\n","id":"https://blog.fsouza.dev/setting-up-django-production/","title":"Setting up a Django production environment: compiling and configuring nginx"},"https://blog.fsouza.dev/splinter-python-tool-for-acceptance/":{"body":"Capybara and\nWebrat are great Ruby tools for acceptance\ntests. A few months ago, we started a great tool for acceptance tests in\nPython web applications, called\nSplinter. There are many acceptance test\ntools on Python world: Selenium,\nAlfajor,\nWindmill,\nMechanize,\nzope.testbrowser, etc.\nSplinter was not created to be another acceptance tool, but an abstract layer\nover other tools, its goal is provide a unique API that make acceptance testing\neasier and funnier.\nIn this post, I will show some basic usage of Splinter for simple web\napplication tests. Splinter is a tool\nuseful on tests of any web application. You can even test a Java web\napplication using Splinter. This post example is a \"test\" of a Facebook\nfeature, just because I want to focus on how to use Splinter, not on how to\nwrite a web application. The feature to be tested is the creation of an event\n(the Splinter sprint), following all the flow: first the user will login on\nFacebook, then click on \"Events\" menu item, then click on \"Create an Event\"\nbutton, enter all event information and click on \"Create event\" button. So,\nlet’s do it…\nFirst step is create a\nBrowser\ninstance, which will provide method for interactions with browser (where the\nbrowser is: Firefox, Chrome, etc.). The code we need for it is very simple:\nbrowser = Browser(\"firefox\")\n\nBrowser is a class and its constructor receives the driver to be used with\nthat instance. Nowadays, there are three drivers for Splinter: firefox,\nchrome and zope.testbrowser. We are using Firefox, and you can easily use\nChrome by simply changing the driver from firefox to chrome. It’s also very\nsimple to add another driver to Splinter, and I plan to cover how to do that in\nanother blog post here.\nA new browser session is started when we got the browser object, and this is\nthe object used for Firefox interactions. Let's start a new event on Facebook,\nthe Splinter Sprint. First of all, we need to visit the Facebook homepage.\nThere is a visit method on Browser class, so we can use it:\nbrowser.visit(\"https://www.facebook.com\")\n\nvisit is a blocking operation: it waits for page to load, then we can\nnavigate, click on links, fill forms, etc. Now we have Facebook homepage opened\non browser, and you probably know that we need to login on Facebook page, but\nwhat if we are already logged in? So, let's create a method that login on\nFacebook with provided authentication data only the user is not logged in\n(imagine we are on a TestCase class):\ndef do_login_if_need(self, username, password):\n    if self.browser.is_element_present_by_css('div.menu_login_container'):\n        self.browser.fill('email', username)\n        self.browser.fill('pass', password)\n        self.browser.find_by_css('div.menu_login_container input[type=\"submit\"]').first.click()\n        assert self.browser.is_element_present_by_css('li#navAccount')\n\nWhat was made here? First of all, the method checks if there is an element\npresent on the page, using a CSS selector. It checks for a div that contains\nthe username and password fields. If that div is present, we tell the\nbrowser object to fill those fields, then find the submit button and click on\nit. The last line is an assert to guarantee that the login was successful and\nthe current page is the Facebook homepage (by checking the presence of\n“Account” li).\nWe could also find elements\nby its texts, labels or whatever appears on screen, but remember: Facebook is\nan internationalized web application, and we can’t test it using only a\nspecific language.\nOkay, now we know how to visit a webpage, check if an element is present, fill\na form and click on a button. We're also logged in on Facebook and can finally\ngo ahead create the Splinter sprint event. So, here is the event creation\nflow, for a user:\n\nOn Facebook homepage, click on “Events” link, of left menu\nThe “Events” page will load, so click on “Create an Event” button\nThe user see a page with a form to create an event\nFill the date and chose the time\nDefine what is the name of the event, where it will happen and write a short\ndescription for it\nInvite some guests\nUpload a picture for the event\nClick on “Create Event” button\n\nWe are going to do all these steps, except the 6th, because the Splinter Sprint\nwill just be a public event and we don’t need to invite anybody. There are some\nboring AJAX requests on Facebook that we need to deal, so there is not only\nSplinter code for those steps above. First step is click on “Events” link. All\nwe need to do is find the link and click on it:\nbrowser.find_by_css('li#navItem_events a').first.click()\n\nThe find_by_css method takes a CSS selector and returns an\nElementList.\nSo, we get the first element of the list (even when the selector returns only\nan element, the return type is still a list) and click on it. Like visit\nmethod, click is a blocking operation: the driver will only listen for new\nactions when the request is finished (the page is loaded).\nWe’re finally on \"new event\" page, and there is a form on screen waiting for data of the Splinter Sprint. Let’s fill the form. Here is the code for it:\nbrowser.fill('event_startIntlDisplay', '5/21/2011')\nbrowser.select('start_time_min', '480')\nbrowser.fill('name', 'Splinter sprint')\nbrowser.fill('location', 'Rio de Janeiro, Brazil')\nbrowser.fill('desc', 'For more info, check out the #cobratem channel on freenode!')\n\nThat is it: the event is going to happen on May 21th 2011, at 8:00 in the\nmorning (480 minutes). As we know, the event name is Splinter sprint, and we\nare going to join some guys down here in Brazil. We filled out the form using\nfill and select methods.\nThe fill method is used to fill a \"fillable\" field (a textarea, an input,\netc.). It receives two strings: the first is the name of the field to fill\nand the second is the value that will fill the field. select is used to\nselect an option in a select element (a “combo box”). It also receives two\nstring parameters: the first is the name of the select element, and the\nsecond is the value of the option being selected.\nImagine you have the following select element:\n&lt;select name=\"gender\"&gt;\n    &lt;option value=\"m\"&gt;Male&lt;/option&gt;\n    &lt;option value=\"f\"&gt;Female&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n\nTo select “Male”, you would call the select method this way:\nbrowser.select(\"gender\", \"m\")\n\nThe last action before click on “Create Event” button is upload a picture for\nthe event. On new event page, Facebook loads the file field for picture\nuploading inside an iframe, so we need to switch to this frame and interact\nwith the form present inside the frame. To show the frame, we need to click on\n“Add Event Photo” button and then switch to it, we already know how click on a\nlink:\nbrowser.find_by_css('div.eventEditUpload a.uiButton').first.click()\n\nWhen we click this link, Facebook makes an asynchronous request, which means\nthe driver does not stay blocked waiting the end of the request, so if we try\nto interact with the frame BEFORE it appears, we will get an\nElementDoesNotExist exception. Splinter provides the is_element_present\nmethod that receives an argument called wait_time, which is the time Splinter\nwill wait for the element to appear on the screen. If the element does not\nappear on screen, we can’t go on, so we can assume the test failed (remember we\nare testing a Facebook feature):\nif not browser.is_element_present_by_css('iframe#upload_pic_frame', wait_time=10):\n    fail(\"The upload pic iframe did'n't appear :(\")\n\nThe is_element_present_by_css method takes a CSS selector and tries to find\nan element using it. It also receives a wait_time parameter that indicates a\ntime out for the search of the element. So, if the iframe element with\nID=”upload_pic_frame” is not present or doesn’t appear in the screen after 10\nseconds, the method returns False, otherwise it returns True.\n\nImportant: fail is a pseudocode sample and doesn’t exist (if you’re\nusing unittest library, you can invoke self.fail in a TestCase, exactly\nwhat I did in [complete snippet for this\nexample](https://github.com/cobrateam/splinter/blob/master/samples/test_facebook_events.py\n\"Snippet for creating a new event on Facebook using Splinter\"), available at\nGithub).\n\nNow we see the iframe element on screen and we can finally upload the\npicture. Imagine we have a variable that contains the path of the picture (and\nnot a file object, StringIO, or something like this), and this variable name\nis picture_path, this is the code we need:\nwith browser.get_iframe('upload_pic_frame') as frame:\n    frame.attach_file('pic', picture_path)\n    time.sleep(10)\n\nSplinter provides the get_iframe method that changes the context and returns\nanother objet to interact with the content of the frame. So we call the\nattach_file method, who also receives two strings: the first is the name of\nthe input element and the second is the absolute path to the file being sent.\nFacebook also uploads the picture asynchronously, but there’s no way to wait\nsome element to appear on screen, so I just put Python to sleep 10 seconds on\nlast line.\nAfter finish all these steps, we can finally click on “Create Event” button and\nasserts that Facebook created it:\nbrowser.find_by_css('label.uiButton input[type=\"submit\"]').first.click()\ntitle = browser.find_by_css('h1 span').first.text\nassert title == 'Splinter sprint'\n\nAfter create an event, Facebook redirects the browser to the event page, so we\ncan check if it really happened by asserting the header of the page. That’s\nwhat the code above does: in the new event page, it click on submit button, and\nafter the redirect, get the text of a span element and asserts that this text\nequals to “Splinter sprint”.\nThat is it!

In\nthis post, I will show how to develop a very simple jQuery plugin (based on an\nexample that I learned with Ricard D. Worth): zebrafy.\nThis plugin “zebrafies” a table, applying different classes to odd and even\nlines. Let’s start setting up a Jasmine environment... First step is download\nthe standalone version of\nJasmine, then extract it and\nedit the runner. The runner is a simple HTML file, that loads Jasmine and all\nJavaScript files you want to test. But, wait... why not test using node.js or\nsomething like this? Do I really need the browser on this test? You don’t\nneed, but I think it is important to test a plugin that works with the DOM\nusing a real browser. Let’s delete some files and lines from SpecRunner.html\nfile, so we adapt it for our plugin. This is how the structure is going to look\nlike:\n.\n├── SpecRunner.html\n├── lib\n│   ├── jasmine-1.0.2\n│   │   ├── MIT.LICENSE\n│   │   ├── jasmine-html.js\n│   │   ├── jasmine.css\n│   │   └── jasmine.js\n│   └── jquery-1.6.1.min.js\n├── spec\n│   └── ZebrafySpec.js\n└── src\n    └── jquery.zebrafy.js\n\nYou can create the files jquery.zebrafy.js and ZebrafySpec.js, but\nremember: it is BDD, we need to describe\nthe behavior first, then write the code. So let’s start writing the specs in\nZebrafySpec.js file using Jasmine. If you are familiar with\nRSpec syntax, it’s easy to understand how to write spec\nwiths Jasmine, if you aren’t, here is the clue: Jasmine is a lib with some\nfunctions used for writing tests in an easier way. I’m going to explain each\nfunction “on demmand”, when we need something, we learn how to use it! ;)\nFirst of all, we need to start a new test suite. Jasmine provides the\ndescribe function for that, this function receives a string and another\nfunction (a callback). The string describes the test suite and the function is\na callback that delimites the scope of the test suite. Here is the Zebrafy\nsuite:\ndescribe('Zebrafy', function () {\n\n});\n\nLet’s start describing the behavior we want to get from the plugin. The most\nbasic is: we want different CSS classes for odd an even lines in a table.\nJasmine provides the it function for writing the tests. It also receives a\nstring and a callback: the string is a description for the test and the\ncallback is the function executed as test. Here is the very first test:\nit('should apply classes zebrafy-odd and zebrafy-even to each other table lines', function () {\n    var table = $(\"#zebra-table\");\n    table.zebrafy();\n    expect(table).toBeZebrafyied();\n});\n\nOkay, here we go: in the first line of the callback, we are using jQuery to\nselect a table using the #zebra-table selector, which will look up for a\ntable with the ID attribute equals to “zebra-table”, but we don’t have this\ntable in the DOM. What about add a new table to the DOM in a hook executed\nbefore the test run and remove the table in another hook that runs after the\ntest? Jasmine provide two functions: beforeEach and afterEach. Both\nfunctions receive a callback function to be executed and, as the names suggest,\nthe beforeEach callback is called before each test run, and the afterEach\ncallback is called after the test run. Here are the hooks:\nbeforeEach(function () {\n    $('&lt;table id=\"zebra-table\"&gt;&lt;/table&gt;').appendTo('body');\n    for (var i=0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n        $('&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;').append('&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;').append('&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;').append('&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;').appendTo('#zebra-table');\n    };\n});\n\nafterEach(function () {\n    $(\"#zebra-table\").remove();\n});\n\nThe beforeEach callback uses jQuery to create a table with 10 rows and 3\ncolumns and add it to the DOM. In afterEach callback, we just remove that\ntable using jQuery again. Okay, now the table exists, let’s go back to the\ntest:\nit('should apply classes zebrafy-odd and zebrafy-even to each other table lines', function () {\n    var table = $(\"#zebra-table\");\n    table.zebrafy();\n    expect(table).toBeZebrafyied();\n});\n\nIn the second line, we call our plugin, that is not ready yet, so let’s forward\nto the next line, where we used the expect function. Jasmine provides this\nfunction, that receives an object and executes a matcher against it, there is\na lot of built-in matchers on Jasmine, but toBeZebrafyied is not a built-in\nmatcher. Here is where we know another Jasmine feature: the capability to write\ncustom matchers, but how to do this? You can call the beforeEach again, and\nuse the addMatcher method of Jasmine object:\nbeforeEach(function () {\n    this.addMatchers({\n        toBeZebrafyied: function() {\n            var isZebrafyied = true;\n\n            this.actual.find(\"tr:even\").each(function (index, tr) {\n                isZebrafyied = $(tr).hasClass('zebrafy-odd') === false &amp;&amp; $(tr).hasClass('zebrafy-even');\n                if (!isZebrafyied) {\n                    return;\n                };\n            });\n\n            this.actual.find(\"tr:odd\").each(function (index, tr) {\n                isZebrafyied = $(tr).hasClass('zebrafy-odd') &amp;&amp; $(tr).hasClass('zebrafy-even') === false;\n                if (!isZebrafyied) {\n                    return;\n                };\n            });\n\n            return isZebrafyied;\n        }\n    });\n});\n\nThe method addMatchers receives an object where each property is a matcher.\nYour matcher can receive arguments if you want. The object being matched can be\naccessed using this.actual, so here is what the method above does: it takes\nall odd &lt;tr&gt; elements of the table (this.actual) and check if them have the\nCSS class zebrafy-odd and don’t have the CSS class zebrafy-even, then do\nthe same checking with even &lt;tr&gt; lines.\nNow that we have wrote the test, it’s time to write the plugin. Here some\njQuery code:\n(function ($) {\n    $.fn.zebrafy = function () {\n        this.find(\"tr:even\").addClass(\"zebrafy-even\");\n        this.find(\"tr:odd\").addClass(\"zebrafy-odd\");\n    };\n})(jQuery);\n\nI’m not going to explain how to implement a jQuery\nplugin neither what are those\nbrackets on\nfunction,\nthis post aims to show how to use Jasmine to test jQuery plugins.\nBy convention, jQuery plugins are “chainable”, so let’s make sure the zebrafy\nplugin is chainable using a spec:\nit('zebrafy should be chainable', function() {\n    var table = $(\"#zebra-table\");\n    table.zebrafy().addClass('black-bg');\n    expect(table.hasClass('black-bg')).toBeTruthy();\n});\n\nAs you can see, we used the built-in matcher toBeTruthy, which asserts that\nan object or expression is true. All we need to do is return the jQuery\nobject in the plugin and the test will pass:\n(function ($) {\n    $.fn.zebrafy = function () {\n        return this.each(function (index, table) {\n            $(table).find(\"tr:even\").addClass(\"zebrafy-even\");\n            $(table).find(\"tr:odd\").addClass(\"zebrafy-odd\");\n        });\n    };\n})(jQuery);\n\nSo, the plugin is tested and ready to release! :) You can check the entire code\nand test with more spec in a GitHub\nrepository.\n","id":"https://blog.fsouza.dev/testing-jquery-plugins-with-jasmine/","title":"Testing jQuery plugins with Jasmine"},"https://blog.fsouza.dev/using-juju-to-orchestrate-centos-based/":{"body":"Earlier this week I had the opportunity to meet Kyle\nMacDonald, head of Ubuntu\nCloud, during FISL, and he\nwas surprised when we told him we are using Juju with\nCentOS at\nGlobo.com. Then I decided to write this post explaining how we came up with a\npatched version of Juju that\nallows us to have CentOS clouds managed by Juju.\nFor those who doesn't know Juju, it's a service orchestration tool, focused on\ndevops \"development method\". It allows\nyou to deploy services on clouds, local machine and even bare metal machines\n(using Canonical's MAAS).\nIt's based on charms and very\nstraightforward to use. Here is a very basic set of commands with which you can\ndeploy a Wordpress related to a MySQL service:\n% juju bootstrap\n% juju deploy mysql\n% juju deploy wordpress\n% juju add-relation wordpress mysql\n% juju expose wordpress\n\nThese commands will boostrap the environment, setting up a bootstrap machine\nwhich will manage your services; deploy mysql and wordpress instances; add a\nrelation between them; and expose the wordpress port. The voilà, we have a\nwordpress deployed, and ready to serve our posts. Amazing, huh?\nBut there is an issue: although you can install the juju command line tool in\nalmost any OS (including Mac OS), right now you are able do deploy only\nUbuntu-based services (you must use an Ubuntu instance or container).\nTo change this behavior, and enable Juju to spawn CentOS instances (and\ncontainers, if you have a CentOS lxc template), we need to develop and apply\nsome changes to Juju and\ncloud-init. Juju uses cloud-init\nto spawn machines with proper dependencies set up, and it's based on modules.\nAll we need to do, is add a module able to install rpm packages using yum.\ncloud-init modules are Python modules that starts with cc_ and implement a\nhandle function (for example, a module called \"yum_packages\" would be written\nto a file called cc_yum_packages.py). So, here is the code for the module\nyum_packages:\nimport subprocess\nimport traceback\n\nfrom cloudinit import CloudConfig, util\n\nfrequency = CloudConfig.per_instance\n\ndef yum_install(packages):\n    cmd = [\"yum\", \"--quiet\", \"--assumeyes\", \"install\"]\n    cmd.extend(packages)\n    subprocess.check_call(cmd)\n\ndef handle(_name, cfg, _cloud, log, args):\n    pkglist = util.get_cfg_option_list_or_str(cfg, \"packages\", [])\n\n    if pkglist:\n        try:\n            yum_install(pkglist)\n        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n            log.warn(\"Failed to install yum packages: %s\" % pkglist)\n            log.debug(traceback.format_exc())\n            raise\n\n    return True\n\nThe module installs all packages listed in cloud-init yaml file. If we want to install emacs-nox package, we would write this yaml file and use it as user data in the instance:\n#cloud-config\nmodules:\n - yum_packages\npackages: [emacs-nox]\n\ncloud-init already works on Fedora, with Python 2.7, but to work on CentOS 6, with Python 2.6, it needs a patch:\n--- cloudinit/util.py 2012-05-22 12:18:21.000000000 -0300\n+++ cloudinit/util.py 2012-05-31 12:44:24.000000000 -0300\n@@ -227,7 +227,7 @@\n         stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE)\n     out, err = sp.communicate(input_)\n     if sp.returncode is not 0:\n-        raise subprocess.CalledProcessError(sp.returncode, args, (out, err))\n+        raise subprocess.CalledProcessError(sp.returncode, args)\n     return(out, err)\n\nI've packet up this module and this patch in a RPM\npackage that must be\npre-installed in the lxc template and AMI images.
